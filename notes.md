Terminal Echo Issues After Program Quit
After the program quits, depending on your shell, you may find your terminal is still not echoing what you type. Don't worry, it will still listen to what you type. Just press Ctrl-C to start a fresh line of input to your shell, and type in reset and press Enter. This resets your terminal back to normal in most cases. Failing that, you can always restart your terminal emulator. We'll fix this whole problem in the next step.
